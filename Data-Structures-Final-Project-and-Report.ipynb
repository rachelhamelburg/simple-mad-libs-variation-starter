    "For this project, I decided to implement a naive, virtual version of \"Mad Libs\". \"Mad Libs\" is a popular 2-player word game. Typically, Player 1 chooses a story from a collection of stories. Each story is mostly complete, but there are blanks where certain parts of speech (pos) would go. Player 1 prompts Player 2 for those pos's without reading them the story. At the end, Player 1 reads the story out loud to Player 2. One funny example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iClgRjmTvc&list=PLykzf464sU98HizZQOzYfvUOjjRSm9XLA&index=7 .\n",
    "\n",
    "In my application, Player 1 does not choose a story, but comes up with one. Then, the application prompts Player 2 for words, reconstructs the story with those words, and then Player 1 reads the story out loud. As we walk through the code, I will explain why / how the most appropriate structure to support my application is an array. More specifically, a dynamic array ADT with Python's list type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of my code just deals with getting user input. It explains directions, asks for names of the players, and offers titles for inspiration if Player 1 needs it. You can see in the above code that I entered my name, my friend's name, asked to see two rounds of potential title options, enter one of those titles, and then created my story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the application comes after the user's input, 'write' is entered, and is where I will explain the approach step-by-step. In my explanation, I will replace the user input story with some sample text for readibility and easier comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process Player 1's input, I imported a word tokenizer from NLTK, which is a library with useful packages for NLP tasks with Python. As the name suggests, the word_tokenizer tokenizes our text into words (more specifically, it tokenizes a string into a list of substrings). NLTK tokenizer and pos-tagger instantiate a list of tuples, 'tagged' (In this explanation, I've labeled it 'sample_tagged').   The tuples that the pos tagger produce are composed of this tokenized word, and its associated part of speech. Here is an example of how this works:"

    "At first glance, one might ask why I did not change this list into a dictionary or create a dictionary. After all, after using the NLTK pos-tagged, many go on to change the data structure for further processing, like graph representations (for understanding semantic relationships), objects and classes (for N.E.R.), and more.  I originally thought that implementing a dictionary with key (pos) value (words) pairs would be the most efficient option for this project, and was hesitant at the thought of just replacing tuple items. However, the key to successful word-games like mad libs is maintaining word position in a sentence. This is why I decided to stick with a list. In a dictionary, when several values are associated with one key, they have to be stored in an iterable, like a list. You would have to iterate all the values of that list before moving to the next key (pos). This will disturb the order of the sentence. Have a look at the output in the cell below, which shows the comparison between the original text and the modified text if we use a dictionary when a sentence contains 2 adverbs."

For those matches, we create user-friendly labels, so that the user is prompted with \"Noun, Adjective, etc.\", instead of Penn Treebank syntax: \"NN\", \"JJ\". The last line replaces the tuple at the appropriate index with their input and pos. This is another benefit of the list in Python, and another reason why I chose it - because it is mutable and dynamic.

You could have it generate stories based on an idea you have, and its understanding of pos's undoubtedly has the potential to be more robust."
